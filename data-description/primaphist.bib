The inventory is based on version 2.0 of the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR 2.0). In EDGAR the emissions are calculated per country and economic sector using an emission factor approach. Calculations of the emissions with 10 year intervals are based on historical activity statistics and selected emission factors. Historical activity data were derived from the Hundred Year Database for Integrated Environmental Assessments (18901990) supplemented with other data and our own estimates. Emission factors account for changes in economical and technological developments in the past. The calculated emissions on a country basis have been interpolated onto a 11 grid. This consistent data set can be used in trend studies of tropospheric trace gases and in environmental assessments, for example, the analysis of historical contributions of regions and countries to environmental forcing like the enhanced greenhouse gas effect, acidification, and eutrofication. The database focuses on energy/industrial and agricultural/waste sources; for completeness, historical biomass-burning estimates where added using a simple and transparent approach.},

We combine several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of emissions pathways for each country and Kyoto gas, covering the years 1850 to 2014 with yearly values, for all UNFCCC member states and most non-UNFCCC territories. The sectoral resolution is that of the main IPCC 1996 categories. Additional time series of CO2 are available for energy and industry subsectors. Country-resolved data are combined from different sources and supplemented using year-to-year growth rates from regionally resolved sources and numerical extrapolations to complete the dataset. Regional deforestation emissions are downscaled to country level using estimates of the deforested area obtained from potential vegetation and simulations of agricultural land. In this paper, we discuss the data sources and methods used and present the resulting dataset, including its limitations and uncertainties.

  abstract = {The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) compiles anthropogenic global emissions and trends based on international statistics and best-available emission factors, for the use in atmospheric models and in policy evaluation. The new version v4.3.2 of the EDGAR emission inventory provides global emission estimates, disaggregated at source-sector level, for the historic period from 1970 (the year of EU's first Air Quality Directive) until 2012 (the end year of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol). The global geo-coverage and continuous time-series are strengths of the EDGAR database, which applies the same methodology and mainly default emission factors to all world countries, in order to achieve comparability and full transparency. Region-specific emission factors are selected, when these are recommended by IPCC (2006) guidelines or when these are justified by robust information on significant differences in economic activities, in customs or in geographical ambient conditions and proven to be more representative than the global average. This database is not only unique in its space-time coverage, but also in the completeness and consistency of the estimated emissions of multiple pollutants: the greenhouse gases (GHG), air pollutants and aerosols. This publication documents the first part of the EDGAR v4.3.2 emissions database focusing on emissions of the three major greenhouse gases of CO2, CH4 and N2O, from human activities apart from the land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector (including forest and savannah burning). Unlike the activities of the LULUCF sector, which are typically estimated top-down from less certain land-use observations, all these activities are estimated bottom-up from standard annual statistics of fuel, products, waste, crops or livestock. We present country-specific emission totals and analyse the trends and variations in emissions of the largest emitting countries together with the EU in more detail, to uncover the effect of changes in human activities with time on each of the gases. The GWP-100 weighted global total GHG emission trend is predominantly determined by the global CO2 trend and in particular, by fuel markets trends, geopolitical changes and financial crises rather than population changes. We also evaluate the uncertainty in emissions for different sectors and three groups of countries (the OECD countries of 1990, the countries with economies in transition in 1990 and the remaining non-Annex I countries). Even though large progress has been made on emission inventory compilation, the uncertainty in global total GHG emissions has not decreased, because of the increasing share of emissions from countries with less developed statistical infrastructure and secondly the decreasing share of emissions from the activities (e.g. coal power plants) for which relatively accurate information is available. Finally, we discuss changes in geospatial distribution with a focus on hot spots and megacities using gridded information. Data is presented online for each source category with annual and monthly global emissions grid-maps of 0.1\&deg; \&times; 0.1\&deg; resolution and can be freely accessed from the EDGAR website http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=432\&SECURE=123 (DOI: https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2904/JRC\_DATASET\_EDGAR).},

  doi = {10.5194/essd-2016-58},
  abstract = {This paper presents an update and expansion of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE, v 3.2.000). HYDE is and internally consistent combination of updated historical population estimates and enhanced allocation algorithms with weighting maps for land use which are time-dependent. Categories include cropland, with a new distinction into irrigated and rain fed crops (other than rice) and irrigated and rain fed rice. Also grazing lands are provided, divided into more intensively used pasture and less intensively used rangeland. Population is represented by maps of total, urban, rural population and population density as well as built-up area. The period covered is 10\&thinsp;000\&thinsp;BCE to 2015\&thinsp;CE. We estimate that global population increased from 4.4 million people in 10\&thinsp;000 BCE to 7310\&thinsp;million in 2015\&thinsp;CE, resulting in a global population density increase of \&minus;2 to almost 56\&thinsp;cap\&thinsp;km\&minus;2 respectively. The urban built-up area evolved from almost zero to roughly 450\&thinsp;Mha at present, still only less than 0.5\&thinsp;\% of the total land surface of the globe. Cropland occupied approximately less than 1\&thinsp;\% of the global land area for a long time period until 1000\&thinsp;CE, quite similar like the grazing land area. In the next centuries the share of global cropland slowly grew to 2.3\&thinsp;\% in 1700\&thinsp;CE (ca. 294\&thinsp;Mha), 4.5\&thinsp;\% in 1850\&thinsp;CE (580\&thinsp;Mha) and 11\&thinsp;\% in 2015\&thinsp;CE (ca. 1564\&thinsp;Mha). Cropland can be further divided into rain-fed and irrigated land, and these categories can be further divided into rice and non-rice. Rainfed croplands are much more common with 2.2\&thinsp;\% in 1700\&thinsp;CE (294\&thinsp;Mha), 4.2\&thinsp;\% (552\&thinsp;Mha) in 1850\&thinsp;CE and 10\&thinsp;\% (1298\&thinsp;Mha) in 2015 CE, while irrigated croplands used less than 0.05\&thinsp;\% (5\&thinsp;Mha), 0.2\&thinsp;\% (28\&thinsp;Mha) and 2.0\&thinsp;\% in 2015\&thinsp;CE (266\&thinsp;Mha) resp. We estimate the irrigated rice area (paddy) at 0.02\&thinsp;\% in 1700\&thinsp;CE (2.7\&thinsp;Mha), 0.1\&thinsp;\% (127\&thinsp;Mha) in 1850\&thinsp;CE and 0.6\&thinsp;\% in 2015\&thinsp;CE (73\&thinsp;Mha). The share of grazing land grew from 5.1\&thinsp;\% in 1700\&thinsp;CE (668\&thinsp;Mha) to 9.2\&thinsp;\% in 1850\&thinsp;CE (1200\&thinsp;Mha) and 25.2\&thinsp;\% in 2015\&thinsp;CE (3284\&thinsp;Mha). Land used for grazing can be divided into more intensively used pasture and less (or not) managed rangeland. Pasture occupied 1.1\&thinsp;\% in 1700\&thinsp;CE (149\&thinsp;Mha), 2.0\&thinsp;\% in 1850\&thinsp;CE (257\&thinsp;Mha) and 6.1\&thinsp;\% (800\&thinsp;Mha) in 2015\&thinsp;CE, while rangelands usually occupy more space due to the occurrence in more arid regions and thus lower yields to sustain livestock. We estimate 4\&thinsp;\% in 1700\&thinsp;CE (519\&thinsp;Mha), 7.2\&thinsp;\% in 1850\&thinsp;CE (943\&thinsp;Mha) and 19\&thinsp;\% in 2015\&thinsp;CE (2483\&thinsp;Mha).

However, the hierarchical categorisation of data in the IPCC 2006 guidelines is not readily extracted from the reporting tables. We present the PRIMAP-crf data as a re-constructed hierarchical dataset according to the IPCC 2006 guidelines. Furthermore, the data is organised in a series of tables containing all available countries and years for each GHG individual gas and category reported. In addition to single gases, the Kyoto basket of greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O, CH4, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3) is provided according to multiple global warming potentials. The dataset was produced using the PRIMAP emissions module. Key processing steps include; extracting data from submitted CRF excel spreadsheets, mapping CRF categories to IPCC 2006 categories, constructing missing categories from available data, and aggregating single gases to gas baskets.

GDP estimates have been routinely assembled only since the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, making comparisons with prior periods cumbersome or even impossible. In recent years various efforts have been put forward to re-estimate national GDP for specific years in the past centuries and even millennia, providing new insights of past economic development on a snapshot basis. In order to make this wealth of data utilizable across research disciplines, we here present a first continuous and consistent data set of GDP time series for 195 countries from 1850 to 2009, based mainly on data from the Maddison Project and other population and GDP sources. The GDP data is consistent with Penn World Tables v8.1 and future GDP projections from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and freely available at https://doi.org/10.5880/pik.2017.003. To ease usability, we additionally provide GPD per capita data and further supplementary and data description files in the online archive. We utilize various methods to handle missing data and discuss the advantages and limitations of our methodology.

The required data for estimating emissions from global cement production are poor, and it has been recognised that some global estimates are significantly inflated. Here we assemble a large variety of available datasets and prioritise official data and emission factors, including estimates submitted to the UNFCCC plus new estimates for China and India, to present a new analysis of global process emissions from cement production. We show that global process emissions in 2016 were 1.45$\pm$0.20Gt CO\textsubscript{2}, equivalent to about 4\% of emissions from fossil fuels. Cumulative emissions from 1928 to 2016 were 39.3$\pm$2.4Gt CO\textsubscript{2}, 66\% of which have occurred since 1990.
